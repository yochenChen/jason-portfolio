            I am a software engineer with experience building enterprise systems,
            ERP features, internal portals, and cloud-based business applications.
            My background combines backend development, system integration, and
            practical delivery for real business environments.
          </p>

          <p>
            I previously worked on ASP.NET Core, Angular, SQL Server, and Azure
            DevOps projects, including procurement systems, ERP modernization, and
            internal information platforms. I enjoy building maintainable systems
            that connect engineering execution with business value.

          <p>
            I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science at Stevens Institute
            of Technology, where I am continuing to strengthen my skills in software
            engineering, web development, and data-driven applications.
